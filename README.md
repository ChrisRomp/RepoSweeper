 <h1> RepoSweeper </h1>

 Deleting GitHub repositories via the GitHub interface is a hassle. For each repository that you want to delete, you have to go to the individual repository settings, enter the name of the repository and confirm. This is not a scalable as task. There are many scripts you can use to bulk erase repositories from the command line, but they don't offer much flexibility. RepoSweeper is a React.js SPA that allows you to sort, filter and manage which repositories you want to delete, and to do so in one click of a button.

 Getting Started
 RepoSweeper is a tool that is meant to be used as a web application. It is pretty slim on the code side. If you just want to use the tool, visit https://repo-sweeper.herokuapp.com/

 If you are interested in making changes to the code and working in a development setting, there are three simple steps:

 1. Fork the repository
 2. Git clone the repository in your terminal
 3. npm install

 Start editing as you please, and when you're ready to check out your changes, just run:

 4. npm start
